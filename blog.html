        <h2>1. Renaming the Book</h2>
        <p>If I could give <em>Born a Crime</em> a new title, I would call it: <span class="rename-title">"Between
                Worlds"</span>.</p>
        <p>This new title expresses the idea of internal conflict between freedom and opperation, love and fear, tradition. </p>

            "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient
            women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.'"

            <p>I've seen this dynamic in my own family. My aunt was a successful businesswoman when she married, and her
                husband initially praised her ambition. Over time, however, he began complaining about her work hours
                and subtly undermining her confidence. It culminated in him demanding she quit her job when they had
                children, despite previously agreeing they would share childcare responsibilities.</p>
            <p>What struck me was how gradual this shift was - so slow that my aunt didn't realize how much of herself
                she was losing until she was completely financially dependent on him. This experience made me deeply
                aware of how important it is to maintain one's independence in relationships and to watch for these
                controlling tendencies, no matter how small they may seem at first.</p>
